# Product Recommender System using Machine Learning

This Product Recommender System is my Senior Graduation Project.

It essentialy for E-Commerce Businesses to use for to generate item recommendations for each and every single customer that they are most likely to be interested in buying.

It achieves this task by using already existent sales data of the E-Commerce Business.

But of course the metrics used are not restricted with rows and columns of the dataset, but new features are generated by Feature Engineering methods.

Simply, the machine learning methods, K-Means clustering and K-Nearest Neighbour algorithms are applied to the generated features in order to generate product recommendations for every customer.

Finally, the app compares the results of both KNN and K-Means algorithms to highlight matching recommendations on both of these methods.
The reason for this is to highlight the recommendations that has the highest probability.

This project was initially designed to be a universal and generic, meaning that any E-commerce business that has sales datasets can use this app.

The more specific and shaped-for-brand version is the next step of this project.
The aim is to automate the recommending part into the E-commerce business' framework.
